      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">BasketBall</h1>
      <p>Basketball is a popular team sport played on a rectangular court with two teams of five players each. It is one of the most widely played and watched sports in the world. Basketball originated in the late 19th century in the United States and has since gained global recognition.

        <br>
        Rules and Gameplay:<br>
        Basketball is played with the objective of scoring points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. The team that scores the most points within the allotted time wins the game. The standard basketball court has a hoop at each end, elevated 10 feet above the ground. The teams alternate between offense and defense, with the offense aiming to score while the defense attempts to prevent the opposing team from scoring.
        
        <br>
        The game begins with a jump ball, where the referee tosses the ball into the air between two players from each team, who then try to gain possession. Once a team has possession of the ball, they advance it towards their opponent's basket by dribbling or passing. Dribbling involves bouncing the ball off the floor while moving, and players are required to bounce the ball with one hand at a time.
        
        <br>
        The offensive team tries to create scoring opportunities by passing the ball, setting screens, and executing plays. The primary method of scoring is by shooting the ball into the opponent's hoop. Shots made from outside the three-point line earn three points, while shots made from inside the line are worth two points. Additionally, free throws are awarded when a player is fouled during a shooting attempt, and each successful free throw is worth one point.
        
        <br>
        Defensively, teams aim to prevent their opponents from scoring by blocking shots, stealing the ball, and contesting shots to force missed attempts. They can also employ various defensive strategies such as man-to-man defense, zone defense, or full-court press to disrupt the opposing team's offense.
        
        <br>
        Basketball is a fast-paced game with a 24-second shot clock in most professional leagues. This means that a team must attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession, encouraging quick decision-making and fast-paced action.
        
        <br>
        International and Professional Basketball:<br>
        Basketball is played at both amateur and professional levels globally. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) governs the sport internationally, organizing major competitions such as the FIBA Basketball World Cup and the Olympic basketball tournament.
        
        <br>
        Professional basketball leagues exist in many countries, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) being the most prestigious and popular. The NBA features teams from the United States and Canada and showcases the world's top basketball talent. Other prominent professional leagues include the EuroLeague in Europe, the Australian National Basketball League (NBL), and the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).
        
        <br>
        Basketball Legends:<br>
        Throughout its history, basketball has produced numerous legendary players who have had a significant impact on the sport. Some iconic basketball figures include Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Shaquille O'Neal. These players have achieved great success, both individually and with their respective teams, and have contributed to the popularity and growth of basketball worldwide.</p>
