      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Cricket</h1>
      <p>Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players on a rectangular field called a pitch. It originated in England and has since gained international popularity, becoming particularly prevalent in countries such as India, Australia, England, South Africa, and the West Indies.</p>
    <p>Rules and Gameplay:</p>
    <p>Cricket is a game played in innings, with each team having the opportunity to bat and bowl. The team that wins the toss chooses whether to bat or field first. The objective for the batting team is to score runs, while the bowling team aims to dismiss the batsmen and restrict the opposing team's scoring.
    <p> The game is played with a cricket ball, which is a hard, cork-based ball covered in leather. The pitch is a 22-yard-long strip in the middle of the field, with two sets of wooden stumps at either end. The batting team has two batsmen on the field, and they attempt to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by stopping the ball and dismissing the batsmen through various means.</p>
    <p>There are different formats of cricket, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches, each with its own rules and duration. Test matches are the longest format, played over five days with each team batting twice. ODIs are limited-overs matches, typically played over 50 overs per side, while T20 matches are the shortest, with each team playing 20 overs.
    <p>In cricket, batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. They can also score boundaries by hitting the ball past the fielders to the boundary rope, which awards four runs if the ball reaches the boundary directly, or six runs if the ball crosses the boundary on the full. The number of runs scored determines the team's total, and the team with the higher total wins the match.
         The bowling team aims to dismiss batsmen by getting them out in various ways. The primary methods of dismissal include bowled (when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails), caught (when a fielder catches the ball before it touches the ground), stumped (when the wicketkeeper removes the bails while the batsman is out of the crease), run-out (when the fielding team successfully hits the stumps with the ball while the batsman is running between the wickets), and lbw (leg before wicket, when the ball hits the batsman's leg in line with the stumps and would have gone on to hit the stumps).</p>
    <p>International Cricket:
        Cricket is played at the international level, with teams representing different countries. The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the sport globally and organizes major tournaments such as the ICC Cricket World Cup, the ICC T20 World Cup, and the ICC Champions Trophy. These tournaments feature teams from various countries competing against each other.
        
        In addition to international matches, many countries have domestic cricket leagues that provide opportunities for players to showcase their skills and compete at a professional level. Some of the most prominent domestic leagues include the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia, and the County Championship in England.
    </p>
       <p> Cricketing Legends:
        Throughout its history, cricket has seen numerous legendary players who have left a lasting impact on the sport. Some notable cricketers include Sir Donald Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Sir Vivian Richards, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Richard Hadlee</p>
