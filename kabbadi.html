      <p>Kabaddi is a popular contact sport that originated in ancient India and is now played worldwide. It is a team sport that requires strength, agility, strategy, and teamwork. The game involves two teams, each consisting of seven players on a rectangular court divided into two halves.<br>
        <br>
        Rules and Gameplay:<br>
        The objective of Kabaddi is for a player, known as the "raider," to enter the opposing team's half, tag as many defenders as possible, and return to their own half without getting caught or tackled. The defenders aim to prevent the raider from returning by tackling or restraining them.<br>
        <br>
        The game begins with a toss, and the team that wins the toss sends a raider from their side into the opponent's half. The raider must continuously chant "Kabaddi" while on the opponent's side to prove that they are inhaling without taking an additional breath. This is known as the "cant" or "raiding chant."<br>
        <br>
        The raider can score points by tagging one or more defenders and returning to their half without being caught. For each defender tagged, the raider earns one point. However, if the raider is caught or tackled by the defenders, they are declared out and do not earn any points.<br>
        <br>
        The defenders work as a unit to prevent the raider from returning to their half. They can use various techniques such as grabbing the raider, tackling them to the ground, or forming a chain by holding hands to restrain the raider's movement. If the defenders successfully tackle the raider, they earn a point, and the raider is declared out.<br>
        <br>
        The defending team can revive players who have been declared out if they manage to successfully tag an opposing player during their own raid. This adds an element of strategy, as the defending team must balance between defending and attacking.<br>
        <br>
        Kabaddi matches consist of two halves, typically lasting 20 minutes each, with a short break in between. The teams switch sides after halftime. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br>
        <br>
        Variations of Kabaddi:<br>
        There are different variations of Kabaddi played across the world, each with its own set of rules and formats. Some popular variations include:<br>
        <br>
        1. Standard Kabaddi: This is the most commonly played form of Kabaddi, following the rules mentioned above.<br>
        <br>
        2. Circle Style Kabaddi: In this variation, the court is circular, and there are no defined halves. The raider must touch both sides of the court to score a point.<br>
        <br>
        3. Beach Kabaddi: Played on sand or beach, this variation is similar to standard Kabaddi but with slight modifications to adapt to the surface.<br>
        <br>
        4. Indoor Kabaddi: This version is played on a smaller court and with fewer players. It focuses more on agility and quick reflexes.<br>
        <br>
        Kabaddi at the International Level:<br>
        Kabaddi has gained popularity internationally and is now played in various countries. The International Kabaddi Federation (IKF) governs the sport globally and organizes major tournaments, including the Kabaddi World Cup and the Kabaddi Masters. These tournaments bring together teams from different nations to compete for the championship.<br>
        <br>
        India has been particularly dominant in international Kabaddi, winning multiple World Cups and establishing itself as a powerhouse in the sport. However, countries like Iran, South Korea, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have also showcased strong performances.<br>
        <br>
        Conclusion:<br>
        Kabaddi is a thrilling and physically</p>
