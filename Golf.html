      <p>Golf is a precision club-and-ball sport played on a large outdoor course. It is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and is known for its combination of skill, strategy, and relaxation. Here is some full information about golf:

        <br>
        
        Objective:
        The objective of golf is to complete each hole on the course with the fewest number of strokes possible. Players use a variety of clubs to hit a small ball into a series of holes on the course. The player who completes the entire course with the lowest total score is the winner.
        
        <br>
        
        Course and Holes:
        A golf course typically consists of 18 holes, although there are also 9-hole courses available. Each hole has a teeing ground from where the player starts, a fairway, rough areas, and hazards such as bunkers and water bodies. The ultimate target is the putting green, where the hole is located. The distance between holes can vary, making each course unique.
        
        <br>
        
        Equipment:
        To play golf, players use a set of golf clubs. These clubs are designed for different shots and have varying degrees of loft (angle of the clubface). The most common types of clubs include drivers, irons, wedges, and putters. Players also carry golf balls, tees (used to elevate the ball for the initial shot), and may use accessories like golf gloves and golf bags to carry their equipment.
        
        <br>
        
        Scoring:
        In golf, scoring is based on the number of strokes taken to complete each hole. Each stroke is counted when the player makes an attempt to hit the ball. The fewer strokes taken, the lower the score. At the end of each hole, the player writes down their score and moves on to the next hole. The total score after all holes determines the winner.
        
        <br>
        
        Types of Play:
        Golf can be played in various formats, including stroke play and match play. In stroke play, each player counts the total number of strokes taken during the entire round. The player with the lowest total score wins. In match play, players compete hole-by-hole, and the player or team with the lowest score on each hole wins that particular hole. The player or team with the most holes won at the end of the round is the winner.
        
        <br>
        
        Golf Etiquette and Rules:
        Golf has a strong tradition of etiquette and rules that players are expected to follow. This includes respecting other players, maintaining proper pace of play, repairing divots and ball marks, and keeping noise to a minimum. There are also rules regarding out-of-bounds areas, water hazards, and penalties for various infractions. Golfers are encouraged to learn and understand these rules to play the game fairly and responsibly.
        
        <br>
        
        Professional Golf Tours:
        Professional golfers compete on various tours around the world. The most prestigious tour is the PGA Tour, based in the United States. The European Tour, Asian Tour, and other regional tours also attract top golfers. Major championships, such as The Masters, U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship, are highly anticipated events in the golfing calendar and showcase the best players in the world.
        
        <br>
        
        Golf Legends:
        Golf has a rich history of legendary players who have made significant contributions to the sport. Some of the most notable golfers include Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Annika SÃ¶renstam, and many more. These players have achieved remarkable success, won numerous tournaments, and left a lasting legacy in the game of golf.
        
        <br>
        
        Golf is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Whether played competitively or casually, golf offers a unique and challenging experience set in beautiful surroundings, making it a favorite pastime for many.</p>
