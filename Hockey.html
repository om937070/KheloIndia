      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Hockey</h1>
      <p>Hockey is a fast-paced team sport played on a field between two teams, each consisting of 11 players. It is believed to have originated in ancient civilizations, with the modern version of the game being developed in England in the late 19th century. Hockey has gained immense popularity worldwide and is especially prominent in countries like India, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Australia, Germany, and Argentina.<br><br>
        Rules and Gameplay:<br>
        Hockey is played on a rectangular field called a pitch, with goals at each end. The objective is to score goals by hitting a small, hard ball into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. The team that scores the most goals within the allotted time wins the match.<br>
        The game is played in two halves, with each half typically lasting 35 minutes in international matches. However, the duration may vary in different competitions and levels of play. The players use a variety of skills, including dribbling, passing, tackling, and shooting, to gain possession of the ball, create scoring opportunities, and defend their own goal.<br>
        The stick used in hockey has a long handle and a curved end called the "head" or "hook." The players control the ball by using the flat side of the stick, and they must rely on their hand-eye coordination and stick-handling skills to maneuver the ball effectively.<br>
        There are certain rules and fouls in hockey that players must adhere to. Physical contact is permitted, but excessive force or dangerous play can result in penalties, such as free hits, penalty corners, or even yellow or red cards. Common fouls include obstruction, high sticks, foot fouls, and deliberately playing the ball dangerously.<br><br>
        International Hockey:<br>
        Hockey is played at the international level, with national teams representing their respective countries. The International Hockey Federation (FIH) governs the sport globally and organizes major tournaments such as the Hockey World Cup, the Olympics, and the Hockey Pro League. These events showcase the best teams from around the world competing for prestigious titles.<br>
        The sport is played on both grass and artificial turf surfaces, with the latter being more common in modern-day hockey. The introduction of artificial turf has led to faster gameplay and increased technical skills.<br><br>
        Hockey Legends:<br>
        Over the years, many legendary players have graced the hockey field, leaving an indelible mark on the sport. Some notable hockey players include Dhyan Chand (India), Jamie Dwyer (Australia), Teun de Nooijer (Netherlands), Luciana Aymar (Argentina), Sohail Abbas (Pakistan), and Alyson Annan (Australia). These players have achieved remarkable success and have been an inspiration to aspiring hockey players worldwide.<br>
        Hockey is not only a thrilling sport to watch and play, but it also promotes teamwork, agility, and physical fitness. It requires quick thinking, excellent hand-eye coordination, and the ability to work cohesively with teammates. With its global appeal and exciting gameplay, hockey continues to captivate fans and players around the world.</p>
