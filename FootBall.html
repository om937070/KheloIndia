      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Football</h1>
      <p>Football is a popular team sport played worldwide, known as soccer in some regions. It is played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players, on a rectangular field called a pitch. Football is widely regarded as the most popular sport globally, with millions of fans and numerous professional leagues and tournaments.

        <br>
        <br>Rules and Gameplay:
        <br>Football is played with a spherical ball, and the objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net. Players use any part of their body except their arms and hands (unless they are goalkeepers) to control and pass the ball. The team with the higher number of goals at the end of the match is declared the winner.
        
        <br>The game is divided into two halves, each typically lasting 45 minutes at the professional level, with a halftime break in between. However, the duration may vary in different competitions and age groups. The referee, assisted by two linesmen, enforces the rules and ensures fair play.
        
        <br>Football matches can end in a win, loss, or draw. In knockout competitions or league formats, if the scores are level at the end of regulation time, extra time and penalty shootouts may be used to determine the winner.
        
        <br>Positions and Roles:
        <br>Football teams consist of players in various positions, each with specific roles and responsibilities. The positions include:

        <br>- Defenders: Positioned in the defensive line, their main task is to stop the opposition's attacks and regain possession of the ball.
        <br>- Midfielders: Positioned in the middle of the field, they contribute to both defensive and offensive phases of the game, linking defense with attack and controlling the flow of play.
        <br>- Forwards: Positioned near the opposing team's goal, their primary objective is to score goals and create scoring opportunities.
        
        <br>Professional Leagues and Tournaments:
        <br>Football has numerous professional leagues around the world, with the top leagues attracting the best players and significant global attention. Some of the most renowned leagues include:
